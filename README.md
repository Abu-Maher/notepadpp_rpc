Shows in Discord the file that is currently being edited in [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus). Every time you open, close, save changes, or switch from one file to another, the presence is updated. In case the Notepad++ window is closed, the plugin is uninstalled or disabled from the options, the presence will disappear 

## Installation

To add the plugin to Notepad++, you need to download the zipped file based on your system architecture and in the following path 
 * **C:\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins** or
 * **C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins**

You need to create a folder named DiscordRPC 
* **C:\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins\DiscordRPC**

And paste the content into that folder. If you had Notepad++ open then you should close it and open it again and check if it shows in your profile
