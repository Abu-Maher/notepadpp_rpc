[Version 1.3]
	In this new version 1.3 we have as a novelty that the presence
	now shows the icon of the programming language of the file that
	is currently being edited in Notepad++. This new option can be
	enabled or disabled from the plugin options dialog, by default
	this option is enabled.

	corrected, on the other hand if you notice that something is
	wrong with the plugin, notify me let know so I can fix it!
